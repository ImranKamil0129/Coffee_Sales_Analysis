# Introduction
This project leverages a coffee shop dataset from Kaggle to perform in-depth analysis aimed at driving data-informed decision-making for business expansion and cost optimization. The process involved crafting targeted questions, extensive data exploration, careful data manipulation, and the search for actionable insights and patterns. Ultimately, a compelling dashboard was created to visualize key findings, providing a valuable tool to enhance strategic decision-making.

# Background
Being a coffee addict, My days start with coffee, my breaks need coffee, seomtimes evenings could use a little coffee boost.  It's more than a drink; it's practically my lifeblood. But lately, I've been thinking… there's got to be more to my coffee obsession than just loving the taste. Do I always go to the same coffee shops? Do I have a favorite type of coffee? Does my coffee spending secretly go crazy during certain months?

That's where this sales data comes in! I want to dig in and see what I can uncover. I'm treating this project like an exciting coffee adventure! Let's see what the data says! ☕️

### Questions raised
1. When are the busiest hours and days of the week? Can staffing be adjusted for optimal efficiency while ensuring great customer service during peak times?
2. What are the top-selling products overall, by category and by store? Are any strong sellers specific to certain locations?
3. Can you identify segments of customers based on spending habits, product preferences or times they visit?
4. What are the least popular products overall or in specific stores? Can they be removed or reworked into limited-time offers?

# Tools I Used
- **Python**: Perform Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Searching out what the data could do and what it can uncovers.
- **Power BI**: Develop a dashboard to visualize findings and insights.
